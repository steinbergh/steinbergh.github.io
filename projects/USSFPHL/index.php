					<h2><em>ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE...</em></h2>
					<p>The US Social Forum taking place in Philadelphia summer of 2015 is a convergence driven by the understanding that people&#39;s movements are what create social change. It is an opportunity for regional and issue-specific social justice projects to work towards broader unity. The goal is to map out action plans for a cohesive movement and organize to be on the offense against all forms of oppression.</p>

					<br />
					
					<p>The USSF is the next most important step in our struggle to build a powerful and inclusive movement that transforms this country and the world. We will reach far and near to lift up our people so that they can be heard and know they are not alone.  Through learning together we will tear down divisions and put into practice the idea that 'Your Fight Is My Fight'.
